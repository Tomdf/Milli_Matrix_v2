How to Burn the Bootloader to the milliMATRIX v2
8/25/13

Hardware: AVR Pocket Programmer
Software: Arduino IDE

1. Navigate to the folder: "\Arduino\arduino-1.0.3\hardware\SF32u4_boards-master\bootloaders\caterina"

2. Rename the file "Caterina-promicro16.hex" to "Caterina-promicro16_2.hex"

3. copy "Caterina-promicro8.hex" and rename it "Caterina-promicro16.hex"

4. In the Arduino IDE Select "Sparkfun Pro Micro 5V/16MHz under Tools>Board
	(The Pro Micro files are available from the Sparkfun's website.)

5. Select "USBtinyISP" under Tools>Programmer>

6. Select "Burn Bootloader" under the Tools menu

7. Complete = The programming will take about 30-45 seconds before giving the message "Done Uploading"

To program the bootloader using the Arduino IDE first navigate to the folder
\Arduino\arduino-1.0.3\hardware\SF32u4_boards-master\bootloaders\caterina

Rename the file "Caterina-promicro16.hex" to "Caterina-promicro16_2.hex", then copy
"Caterina-promicro8.hex" and rename it "Caterina-promicro16.hex". This tricks the IDE,
 although I'm not exactly sure how.

Select "Sparkfun Pro Micro 5V/16MHz under Tools>Board (Remember that this actually the 8MHz loader,
	tricked the IDE). The Pro Micro files are available from Sparkfun's site.
Select "USBtinyISP" under Tools>Programmer>
Select "Burn Bootloader" under the Tools menu.
If all goes well, the programming will take about 30-45 seconds before giving the message
"Done Uploading". You are now, ... wait for it,.. done uploading.

Used an AVR Pocket Programmer

Screwed around with the fusebits and lockbits but I'm not sure if it was neccesary

In order to program the bootloader using the arduino IDE I had to first 
rename the file "Caterina-promicro16.hex" to "Caterina-promicro16_2.hex" so that I could copy
"Caterina-promicro8.hex" and rename it "Caterina-promicro16.hex"

These files were all located in
D:\My Documents\Work\Electronics\MicroControllers\Arduino\arduino-1.0.3\hardware\SF32u4_boards-master\bootloaders\caterina

I could then select the Pro Micro 5V from the Board menu, but it is really the 3.3v 8Mhz version's file, and burn the bootloader.

This worked and I was then able to upload sketches to the IC.
