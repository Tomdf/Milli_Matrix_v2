Used an AVR Pocket Programmer

Screwed around with the fusebits and lockbits but I'm not sure if it was neccesary

In order to program the bootloader using the arduino IDE I had to first 
rename the file "Caterina-promicro16.hex" to "Caterina-promicro16_2.hex" so that I could copy
"Caterina-promicro8.hex" and rename it "Caterina-promicro16.hex"

These files were all located in
D:\My Documents\Work\Electronics\MicroControllers\Arduino\arduino-1.0.3\hardware\SF32u4_boards-master\bootloaders\caterina

I could then select the Pro Micro 5V from the Board menu, but it is really the 3.3v 8Mhz version's file, and burn the bootloader.

This worked and I was then able to upload sketches to the IC.
