4. under "promicro8" change the efuse to 0xce

5. save the file as "program.bat"

6. rename the file "build.txt" to "build.bat". The entire line will read as such:
IF "%1"=="promicro8" avrdude -p m32u4 -P usb -c usbtiny -U flash:w:Caterina-promicro8.hex -U efuse:w:0xce:m -U hfuse:w:0xd8:m -U lfuse:w:0xff:m

7. Google for LUFA-111009, download it, and paste it into the 
	bootloaders/caterina folder
	
8. Connect the AVR Pocket Programmer to usb and to the milliMATRIX.

	should show up in device manager and arduino ide as pro micro 8
